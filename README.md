## #9 Project: Linked Lists

A simple project to practice linked lists. Linked lists are crucial for understanding memory management and algorithmic thinking. While dynamically typed languages like JavaScript handles memory abstraction for us, learning linked lists provides insight into how data structures work at a lower level and helps develop problem-solving skills that apply to many programming scenarios.

## Arrays vs Linked Lists

| Aspect | Arrays | Linked Lists |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Contiguous memory blocks | Non-contiguous memory |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | O(n) time complexity | O(1) for head operations |
| **Memory Allocation** | Fixed size (static) or resizable | Dynamic, grows as needed |
| **Access Time** | O(1) constant time access | O(n) linear time access |
| **Memory Efficiency** | May waste memory | Uses memory efficiently |
